                        <p id="p-card">Watching supply and demand is easier than you think, in this example I am going
                            to explain that you only need to know at least two pieces of information to make a high
                            probability entry into the market.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">The two main data you need to know is the delta value of the momentum (upward
                            movement +614) and the delta value of the retracement (downward movement -64), these two
                            data are key to identify imbalances in the market and advantages that we can take advantage
                            of using OTM indicators, here I explain in detail this entry:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">1. Delta value of the ascending wave: in this example it is +614.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">2. MicroDelta indicator: this confirms a large number of aggressive buyers.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">3. Increasing positive cumulative delta: supports the hypothesis of buying
                            pressure in the movement.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">4. No supply in MicroDelta: in this case the amount of sales present in the
                            pullback (drying up) is minimal.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">5. Delta value of the downward wave: it is -64, compared to +614 is 10% of the
                            upward wave, this shows us a great imbalance in favor of the upward movement.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">5. Trading with supply and demand data facilitates decision making and increases

                            one of them is this five star entry, why is it a high probability pattern, let's see:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">1. There is a steady increase in buying, leaving in turn a low aggressiveness on
                            the selling side.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">2. The positive cumulative delta is a great sign of buying pressure and is
                            increasing.
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">3. No response from selling during the pullback wave is a clear sign that buying
                            is in control of the move.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">4. The retracement wave has a positive delta (+37), this represents an imbalance
                            in favor of buyers even in a bearish retracement move, this is a very strong sign of
                            aggressive buying, the delta divergence box is this cherry on top of the cake that we always
                            want to have in our entries.
                        </p>

                        <p id="p-card">The great benefit of using OTM is to recognize high probability patterns with
                            great ease, in these three charts I want to show you the executions taken on 10,11 and 12
                            November 2021, using the same pattern, here I explain them:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">1. Momentum (yellow):This is the first requirement of this pattern, we must have
                            a momentum in favour of the movement in which we are going to take, if we are going to buy
                            we must have delta momentum in favour of buyers (example on the left of the Crude Oil), and
                            if we are going to sell, we must have a momentum in favour of sellers (the other two
                            examples).</p>
                        <p id="p-card">2. Decrease (blue): If we wish to have a high probability on the trade, we must
                            ensure that the delta retracement volume is very low compared to the momentum volume, this
                            is commonly known as "volume drying".</p>
                        <p id="p-card">3. Signal (red): OTM Trading, gives us different signals, these appear when some
                            anomaly occurs and we have some advantage in our favour, the signal that appears in these
                            three executions is the signal of effort No result, which indicates that there is a lot of
                            volume but the movement slows down.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">4. Accumulated Delta (purple): The accumulated delta is the confirmation that we
                            have the pressure in favour of the movement in which we are going to take the operation.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">The key is to have imbalances on one side, this guarantees us to have greater
                            probability in our operations, if you are interested in obtain the OTM tools and have any

                        <p id="p-card">On news we usually don't trade, this is very accurate, however a few minutes
                            after the FOMC pronounces on interest rates, we can get valuable information about the
                            supply and demand behaviour:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">1. Right at the FOMC reports, the delta volume of buying increases massively,
                            there we start to get information, and the first step is to wait for the pullback with some
                            anomaly, it can be decrease in supply volume or effort not result.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">2. The price makes precisely a deep retracement with a signal of effort not
                            result, there we can join in that upward movement.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">3. If we have missed that first movement we get a new confirmation with a huge
                            volume of buying with a consistent result in the price, and subsequently makes a couple of
                            pullbacks with very little supply.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">4. The positive accumulated delta confirms the buying pressure.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">5. There is very little supply on these pullbacks, this is a strong sign of trend
                            continuation.</p>

                            supply/demand imbalance patterns, like this example:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">1. While the price is moving sideways we observe that one of its bullish waves
                            has a negative delta value of -66, this shows us the exhaustion of buying and the presence
                            of selling.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">2. The negative cumulative delta allows us to see the consistency of the selling
                            pressure as the price continues to move sideways.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">3. As the price falls, the negative delta grows each time with no buying
                            response.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">4. At this small retracement we have a sell signal which confirms that the
                            sellers have the upper hand.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">5. The divergence at -6 confirms once again the lack of buying interest in the
                            retracement.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">This entry with more than 5 confirmations allows us to obtain a smooth bearish

                            We must always understand the story behind the entry, here we go with the story of this
                            entry:
                        </p>
                        <p id="p-card">We have a bearish attempt by the price around 8:35am (US open) however it fails in that direction, then a big demand (#1) appears to break the overnight session high (ONH), in OTM we always recommend waiting for the pullback to get a better placement of the entries.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">In that pullback we observe that we have a large decrease in supply, this translates into low interest to trade low prices (#3), in the same way the positive cumulative delta (#2) is increasing.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">As price makes the pullback we have a large Spartan divergence (#4) of +301 positive delta, this is a great sign of buyers during the pullback!!!, this forms a high probability pattern.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">If we are true to the price action, a pennant pattern can be seen in the retracement wave, after this is broken (blue arrow), we can make the entry.</p>
                        <p id="p-card">The exit depends on you, but in this case we have the maximum level of the week that we can take as a reference, obtaining a risk benefit ratio greater than 1:3.</p>

                            Bearish moves are faster than bullish moves, possibly you have missed opportunities by
                            selling, however you can expect this movement pattern that allows you to enter part of that
                            big pullback or a change in price direction.

                            As in the previous examples the OTM Delta Cumulative (#1) allows us to test the transition
                            from sells to buys. Now we require institutional buying impulses (#2), waiting for pullbacks
                            so as not to anticipate, getting confirmations with lack of sales (#4), and confirmations
                            from OTM algorithms (#5,6).
